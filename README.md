I came across this view in my home recently. We have a lot of board games. When we have friends come over and we want to know which games we have to choose from, we often choose the games that are easiest to get to instead of one that might be more appropriate or fun for everyone. 

Iâ€™d like to create an online library for my board game collection. 

Your task, as developers, is to create a web application that will display a list of all the publishers of the board games in the closet. I want to be able to add and delete publishers from this list.

When I click on a publisher, I want to see a view of each game that includes  a picture of the game box, the name of the game, a description of the game and the publisher of the game. 

You can add more features, if you have time. Other features that would be nice would be to include the ages for whom the game is appropriate and the number of players needed (both a min and max). 

For the views, you can be as creative as you like and you may use html, css and javascript, if you like.

Get the game information from web searches and use images that are free and have no copyright issues so I can use them on my website without having to pay for copyrights.
